# Programming project 3: swing GUI for RatingStatsApp
* Due date: Tuesday Dec 1 12:30 p.m.
* Delivery: [README.md](README.md)

##Goal:
The goal of the project is to help students understand the concepts of Java GUI development.  
We will use Java 11 native swing framework, and baseline code provided in https://git.txstate.edu/CS3354/2020Fall.git 
* maven/OOP/ 
* src/project3 folder.  

##Description

This assignment extends RatingStatsApp solution from project1, by replacing console-based user interface with a graphical user interface (GUI).  You have two different options for implementation:

* JFC (Swing/AWT/JAva2D components amd containers)
  * You get to select Swing components to use to achieve the required functionality
  * JFC examples:  
    * src/corejava/v1ch11
    * src/corejava/v2ch11
    * src/t5
	
* JavaFX
  * You get to select Java FX components to use to achieve the required functionality 
  * Examples in 2020Fall.git folder:
    * src/corejava/v1ch13fx

All the operations remain the same as provided in instructor's code
* You CAN modify  all .java files in the starting code of solution3 provided.
* ** Functionalities must remain the same **
* The user input/output needs to be through GUI, **no commandline** selection 

## Tasks:

### Task 1 20 pt

* Submit project3/*.java and project3/*.md files under CS3354/ID.git repository.
* Code compiles and runs, top window displayed.
* Javadoc to document the code and design changes.
* Use of standard Java coding style to improve your programâ€™s visual appearance and make it more readable e.g. https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html

## Task 2 Functional GUI 60 pt

Edit project3 java files so that all user input and output is handled through GUI. 

To receive full credit all functionalities need to work correctly.  
1. Edit RatingStatsApp.java so the class is the main user interface
   * RatingStatsApp class will have to be re-written from scratch. 
2. Edit DatasetHandler.java if necessary. 
   * DatasetHandler class will not require many changes.
3.  Use Table or Dropdown Menu component to visualize data.csv 
   * Is there a better way to make a selection?  
   
## Task 3 Design GUI component 20 pt
 
You have full design freedom. 
* Edit GUI so that new app has a native look and feel using the components.
* Native navigation, resizing.
* User-friendly design, graded on components and visual design choices.
